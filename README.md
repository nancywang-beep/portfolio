# Engineering Portfolio | Yi-Fan (Nancy) Wang

This repository contains the source code for my personal engineering portfolio, showcasing my experience in semiconductor fabrication, power electronics, and parametric characterization.

## 🛠 Featured Projects

### 1. Test Pattern Design and Fabrication (Purdue University)
* **Overview**: Focused on the design, fabrication, and electrical characterization of lithography test patterns used for semiconductor process monitoring.
* **Goal**: Developed robust test structures to extract key process parameters such as sheet resistance, contact resistance, and uniformity.
* **Technical Execution**:
    * Designed full-wafer layouts using **KLayout**, including serpentine resistors, cross-bridge Kelvin resistors (CBKR), and MOS capacitors (MOSCAPs).
    * Performed cleanroom fabrication steps: spin coating, maskless photolithography, and etching.
    * Conducted device-level characterization using probe-station measurements to assess spatial and statistical trends.

### 2. HPE Gen12 Server Power Supply Evaluation (Hewlett Packard Enterprise)
* **Role**: AC Power Engineering Intern (2023-2024).
* **Objective**: Evaluated next-generation power MOSFETs utilizing 3rd-generation semiconductor materials to assess efficiency and thermal benefits in high-power server environments.
* **Engineering Contributions**:
    * Conducted comparative testing of candidate devices under representative operating conditions.
    * Analyzed switching behavior, conversion efficiency, and loss mechanisms (turn-on/turn-off losses) using high-bandwidth oscilloscopes.
    * Identified critical performance trade-offs and thermal integration challenges to guide future platform-level optimization.
